- `ls /var` — Lists the files of the directory /var

- `ls -a` — ls command omits hidden files by default. -a option displays all the hidden files as well. A hidden file is any file (or directory) that begins with a dot . character
- `ls -l /var/log/` — Each file has details associated with it called metadata. This can include information such as the size, ownership, or timestamps. To view this information, use the -l option to the ls command
- `ls -l /var/log/lastlog` — Displays the file information such as the size, ownership, or timestamps.The -l option to the ls command displays file sizes in bytes. For text files, a byte is 1 character. For smaller files, byte sizes are fine. However, for larger files, it is hard to comprehend how large the file is
- `ls -lh /var/log/lastlog` — Displays the file size in a more human-readable size, like megabytes or gigabytes. The -h option must be used with the -l option
- `ls -d` — When the -d option is used, it refers to the current directory, and not the contents within it. Without any other options, it is rather meaningless. Recall that the current directory is always referred to with a single period . character. To use the -d option in a meaningful way requires the addition of the -l option
- `ls -ld` — This indicates that the current directory is being listed, and not the contents
- `ls -R /etc/ppp` — Performs a recursive listing i.e it will list all the files from the dub directories. Be careful with this option; for example, running the command on the root directory would list every file on the file system, including all files on any attached USB device and DVD in the system. Limit the use of recursive listings to smaller directory structures.
- `ls /etc/ssh` — Lists the files of the /etc/ssh. By default, the ls command sorts files alphabetically by file name

- `ls -lSh /etc/ssh` — Lists files from largest to smallest and displays the actual size of the file. -h option to display human-readable file sizes
- `ls -tl /etc/ssh` — -t option sorts files based on the time they were modified. It will list the most recently modified files first. It is important to remember that the modified date on directories represents the last time a file was added to or removed from the directory.
- `ls -t --full-time /etc/ssh` — If the files in a directory were modified many days or months ago, it may be harder to tell exactly when they were modified, as only the date is provided for older files. For more detailed modification time information you can use the --full-time option to display the complete timestamp (including hours, minutes, seconds). It will assume the -l option automatically
- `ls -lrS /etc/ssh` — -r option reverse sort the file based on file size smallest to largest
