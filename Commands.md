## Listing Files & Directories

- `ls` — Lists all the files and directories in current directory
- `ls /etc/ppp /etc/ssh` — The ls command also accepts multiple arguments. To list the contents of both the /etc/ppp and /etc/ssh directories, pass them both as arguments
- `ls /etc/ppp` — List the files and directories from /etc/ppp
- `ls -l` — Lists the files with size, date and permissions
- `ls -lr` — Lists the files with size, date and permissions and in reverse alphabetical order
- `ls -l /usr/bin/perl` — By default the -l option of the ls command displays files sizes in bytes
- `ls -lh` — Lists the files with size, date and permissions and size of the file in human readable form i.e KB, MB and GB
- `ls -l --human-readable /usr/bin/perl` — Equivalent option for h. Supported mostly in modern Linux System
- `ls` — Lists all the files and directories in current directory
- `cal 2030` — Displays the calendar for 2030
- `cal 1 2030; cal 2 2030; cal 3 2030` — Displays Jan, Feb, March months Calendars of 2030
- `ls /etc/ppp && echo success` — Lists the directory and prints success if the directory exists
- `ls /etc/junk && echo success` — Lists the directory and prints success if the directory exists. If not error will be thrown
- `ls /etc/ppp || echo failed` — Lists the directory or prints failed
- `ls /etc/junk || echo failed` — Lists the directory or prints failed. If the directory does not exist then failed will be printed
- `ls` — Lists the files and directories
- `ls -l` — Lists the files with size, date and permissions
- `ls -l /tmp` — Lists the attributes of files and directories of /tmp
- `whoami` — Displays the user name of the current user
- `uname` — Displays the kernel you are using
- `uname -n` — Displays the network node hostname
- `uname --nodename` — Displays the network node hostname
- `pwd` — Prints working directory
- `ls /usr/share/doc` — Some system features also have more detailed help documents located in the /usr/share/doc directory structure Execute the following command to view the contents of this document
- `ls /` — lists the contents of the root directory
- `pwd` — To determine where the user is currently located within the filesystem. print working directory command can be used
- `pwd` — Prints Working Directory
- `pwd` — Prints Working Directory
- `ls /var` — Lists the files of the directory /var
- `ls` — Lists the files of the current directory
- `ls -a` — ls command omits hidden files by default. -a option displays all the hidden files as well. A hidden file is any file (or directory) that begins with a dot . character
- `ls -l /var/log/` — Each file has details associated with it called metadata. This can include information such as the size, ownership, or timestamps. To view this information, use the -l option to the ls command
- `ls -l /var/log/lastlog` — Displays the file information such as the size, ownership, or timestamps.The -l option to the ls command displays file sizes in bytes. For text files, a byte is 1 character. For smaller files, byte sizes are fine. However, for larger files, it is hard to comprehend how large the file is
- `ls -lh /var/log/lastlog` — Displays the file size in a more human-readable size, like megabytes or gigabytes. The -h option must be used with the -l option
- `ls -d` — When the -d option is used, it refers to the current directory, and not the contents within it. Without any other options, it is rather meaningless. Recall that the current directory is always referred to with a single period . character. To use the -d option in a meaningful way requires the addition of the -l option
- `ls -ld` — This indicates that the current directory is being listed, and not the contents
- `ls -R /etc/ppp` — Performs a recursive listing i.e it will list all the files from the dub directories. Be careful with this option; for example, running the command on the root directory would list every file on the file system, including all files on any attached USB device and DVD in the system. Limit the use of recursive listings to smaller directory structures.
- `ls /etc/ssh` — Lists the files of the /etc/ssh. By default, the ls command sorts files alphabetically by file name
- `ls -S /etc/ssh` — Sorts the files by size i.e largest to smallest
- `ls -lS /etc/ssh` — Lists files from largest to smallest and displays the actual size of the file.
- `ls -lSh /etc/ssh` — Lists files from largest to smallest and displays the actual size of the file. -h option to display human-readable file sizes
- `ls -tl /etc/ssh` — -t option sorts files based on the time they were modified. It will list the most recently modified files first. It is important to remember that the modified date on directories represents the last time a file was added to or removed from the directory.
- `ls -t --full-time /etc/ssh` — If the files in a directory were modified many days or months ago, it may be harder to tell exactly when they were modified, as only the date is provided for older files. For more detailed modification time information you can use the --full-time option to display the complete timestamp (including hours, minutes, seconds). It will assume the -l option automatically
- `ls -lrS /etc/ssh` — -r option reverse sort the file based on file size smallest to largest
- `ls -lrt /etc/ssh` — -t list files by modification date from newest to oldest, r option reveres it and displays from oldest to newest

- `PATH=/usr/bin/custom:$PATH` — When updating the PATH variable, always include the current path, so as not to lose access to commands located in those directories. This can be accomplished by appending $PATH to the value in the assignment expression. Recall that a variable name preceded by a dollar sign represents the value of the variable.

- `whereis ls` — This command searches for commands, source files and man pages in specific locations where these files are typically stored
- `locate gshadow` — Searches for file or directory with the name gshadow. This command searches a database of all files and directories that were on the system when the database was created. Typically, the command to generate this database is run nightly. Any files created today will not be searchable with the locate command. If root access is available, it’s possible to update the locate database manually by running the updatedb command. Regular users cannot update the database file
- `locate -c passwd` — Displays the number of files matched the text passwd
- `locate -c -b passwd` — Displays only the number of files that has the search text in the base name of the filename
- `locate -b "\passwd"` — Limits the output to filenames that exactly matches the term passwd

For example, placing the cursor on the line * Sorting the output:: and pressing the Enter key, leads to a node that describes sorting the output of the ls command. Note that going into the node about sorting leads into a sub-node of the original. To go back to the previous node, use the U key. While U leads to the start of the node one level up, the L key returns to the same location as before entering the sorting node

While viewing the info page from the previous step, type Shift and the letter h to see a list of movement commands. Note that they are different from the movement commands used in man pages. After reading the movement commands, type the letter l (lowercase L) to return to viewing the document
- `locate crontab` — Searches for files that have crontab as part of their name. An easy way to search for a file is to use the locate command
